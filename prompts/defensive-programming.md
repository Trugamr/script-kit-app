# The Art of Defensive Programming

- Always validate input data
- Use assertions to catch impossible conditions
- Handle exceptions gracefully
- Implement proper error handling and logging
- Use type checking and strong typing
- Avoid global variables when possible
- Initialize variables before use
- Use constants for fixed values
- Implement bounds checking for arrays and buffers
- Use secure coding practices to prevent vulnerabilities
- Write clear and self-documenting code
- Follow the principle of least privilege
- Use design by contract
- Implement proper resource management
- Use defensive copying for mutable objects
- Validate method parameters
- Be cautious with null values
- Use immutable objects when possible
- Implement proper concurrency controls
- Regularly review and refactor code
